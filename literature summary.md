# Vehicle Scrappage and Fleet Turnover: Literature Review

This review maps the literature, anchored in two central studies ([Adda & Cooper 2000](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v108y2000i4p778-806.html); [Jacobsen & van Benthem 2015](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130935)), and extending through related empirical strands. For each study we note its **modeling framework**, **empirical identification**, and **relevance for a Norwegian policy context** characterised by high fuel taxes, CO₂-based vehicle tax regimes and EV incentives.

## Anchor Papers  

**[Adda & Cooper (2000)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v108y2000i4p778-806.html)** – *Balladurette and Juppette: A Discrete Analysis of Scrapping Subsidies*  
- **Approach/Model**: Structural *dynamic discrete-choice* model of household car replacement, building on the dynamic-programming literature (Rust 1987; Hotz & Miller 1993).  
- **Findings/Relevance**: In the French 1994–96 scrappage programmes, subsidies accelerated new-car purchases but triggered a slump afterwards via intertemporal substitution.  
- **Identification**: Model estimated using aggregate French sales and age-distribution data; then policy shocks simulated.  
- **Norwegian context**: Suggests that one-off scrappage incentives may advance purchases rather than create lasting turnover – important for Norway’s EV/ICE transition.

**[Jacobsen & van Benthem (2015)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130935)** – *Vehicle Scrappage and Gasoline Policy*  
- **Approach/Model**: *Reduced-form IV* linking gasoline-price variation to used-car values and scrappage rates, along with a fleet-simulation model.  
- **Findings/Relevance**: Scrap elasticity ≈ –0.7; used-car market delays scrappage when new-vehicle prices rise (“Gruenspecht effect”), leading to 13–16 % of expected fuel savings being lost.  
- **Identification**: Gasoline-price shocks used as instruments for used-car values; large U.S. registration dataset.  
- **Norwegian context**: In a high fuel-tax economy, similar mechanisms likely apply; implies that raising new-car costs (via taxes or standards) risks slowing scrappage unless complemented by targeted retirement incentives.

## Related Strands  

### Scrappage subsidy programmes (“Cash for Clunkers”)  
- **[Mian & Sufi (2012)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/127/3/1107/1924374)** – Diff-in-diff design; found U.S. 2009 programme pulled forward sales (~370 k) but produced no long-run gain.  
- **[Li, Linn & Spiller (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069612000678)** – Diff-in-diff analysis with environmental impact modeling; ~45 % of purchases non-additional; cost per t CO₂ very high.  
- **[Hoekstra, Puller & West (2017)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150172)** – Regression discontinuity at MPG cutoff; many buyers would have purchased anyway; programme shifted buyers to cheaper models, reducing overall spending.  
- **Relevance**: These studies show that scrappage subsidies often **shift timing rather than increase lifetime turnover**; for Norway, targeting and design must ensure additionality and cost-effectiveness.

### Dynamic replacement & consumer behaviour  
- **[Busse, Knittel & Zettelmeyer (2013)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.1.220)** – Reduced-form equilibrium model of car markets; found consumers almost fully value future fuel savings (little myopia).  
- **Relevance**: In Norway’s high fuel-cost environment, consumers likely value fuel economy strongly; scrappage programmes therefore serve more to overcome financing or liquidity constraints than behavioural biases.

### Emission-oriented fleet and technology models  
- **[Knittel (2011)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.7.3368)** – Production-frontier model of vehicle attributes (1980–2006); shows that without strong regulation, technological progress favoured **power and size over fuel efficiency**, underscoring policy’s role in steering innovation.  
- **[Jacobsen, Sallee, Shapiro & van Benthem (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/3/1907/7080183)** – Develops a **quantitative fleet-equilibrium model** of the U.S. vehicle market to evaluate emission standards, age-based fees, and scrappage incentives. Finds that older vehicles account for most remaining fleet emissions, and that age- or emissions-based registration fees deliver larger welfare and environmental gains than further tightening new-vehicle standards, by accelerating the natural retirement of high-emitting cars.
- **Relevance:** Together, these studies show that once new-car emissions are low (as in Norway’s EV market), the key challenge is **retiring older ICE vehicles**. Evidence supports **age- or emissions-linked fees** over additional purchase incentives to achieve deeper, faster decarbonisation.

## Implications for Norway  

High fuel and CO₂ taxes already push Norwegian consumers toward efficient vehicles. Yet raising new-car costs without addressing the used-car market can slow retirement of older cars. Short-term scrappage programs mainly shift purchase timing rather than increase turnover. With the EV market now mature, the key challenge is accelerating the phase-out of legacy ICE vehicles. Age- or emission-based fees and targeted scrappage schemes could deliver greater welfare and environmental gains. Empirical tools such as fuel-price instruments, eligibility cutoffs, and structural models can be applied to Norwegian data to estimate scrap elasticities and inform fleet policy.
