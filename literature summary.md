# Vehicle Scrappage and Fleet Turnover: Literature Review ## Introduction Vehicle scrappage and fleet turnover are pivotal in shaping environmental outcomes and industry dynamics. Scrappage policies – from subsidies to retire old cars to fuel-economy standards that indirectly affect vehicle life-cycles – influence how quickly high-emitting vehicles exit the fleet. This review maps the literature, anchored in two central studies (Adda & Cooper 2000; Jacobsen & van Benthem 2015), and extending through related empirical strands. For each study we note its **modeling framework**, **empirical identification**, and **relevance for a Norwegian policy context** characterised by high fuel taxes, CO₂-based vehicle tax regimes and EV incentives. --- ## Anchor Papers **[Adda & Cooper (2000)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v108y2000i4p778-806.html)** – *Balladurette and Juppette: A Discrete Analysis of Scrapping Subsidies* - **Approach/Model**: Structural *dynamic discrete‐choice* model of household car replacement, building on the dynamic-programming literature (Rust 1987; Hotz & Miller 1993). - **Findings/Relevance**: In the French 1994–96 scrappage programmes, subsidies accelerated new-car purchases but triggered a slump afterwards via intertemporal substitution. - **Identification**: Model estimated using aggregate French sales and age-distribution data; then policy shocks simulated. - **Norwegian context**: Suggests that one-off scrappage incentives may advance purchases rather than create lasting turnover – important for Norway’s EV/ICE transition. **[Jacobsen & van Benthem (2015)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130935)** – *Vehicle Scrappage and Gasoline Policy* - **Approach/Model**: *Reduced-form IV* linking gasoline-price variation to used-car values and scrappage rates, along with a fleet-simulation model. - **Findings/Relevance**: Scrap elasticity ≈ –0.7; used-car market delays scrappage when new vehicle prices rise (“Gruenspecht effect”), leading to ~13-16 % of expected fuel savings being lost. - **Identification**: Gasoline-price shocks used as instruments for used-car values; large U.S. registration dataset. - **Norwegian context**: In a high fuel-tax economy, similar mechanisms likely apply; implies that raising new-car costs (via taxes or standards) risks slowing scrappage unless complemented by targeted retirement incentives. --- ## Related Strands ### Scrappage subsidy programmes (“Cash for Clunkers”) - **[Mian & Sufi (2012)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/127/3/1107/1924374)** – Used diff-in-diff; found U.S. 2009 programme pulled forward sales (~370 k) but produced no long-run gain. - **[Li, Linn & Spiller (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069612000678)** – Combined structural + diff-in-diff; ~45 % of purchases non-additional; cost per t CO₂ very high. - **[Hoekstra, Puller & West (2017)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Cash+for+Corollas%3A+When+Stimulus+Reduces+Spending&btnG=)** – Utilised regression discontinuity at MPG cutoff; many buyers would have purchased anyway; programme shifted buyers to cheaper models, reducing overall spending. - **Relevance**: These studies group together to show that scrappage subsidies often **shift timing rather than increase lifetime turnover**; for Norway, targeting and design must address actual additionality and cost-effectiveness. ### Dynamic replacement & consumer behaviour - **[Busse, Knittel & Zettelmeyer (2013)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Are+Consumers+Myopic%3F+Evidence+from+New+and+Used+Car+Purchases&btnG=)** – Reduced-form equilibrium model of car markets; found consumers almost fully value future fuel savings (little myopia). - **Relevance**: In Norway’s high fuel-cost environment, consumers likely value fuel economy strongly; scrappage programmes hence serve more to overcome financing or other frictions rather than behaviour. ### Emission-oriented fleet and technology models - **[Knittel (2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Automobiles+on+Steroids%3A+Product+Attribute+Trade-Offs+and++Technological+Progress+in+the+Automobile+Sector&btnG=)** Uses a production-frontier model of vehicle attributes (1980–2006) to show that, absent strong regulation, technological progress in the auto industry was directed toward **greater power and size rather than fuel efficiency**. Highlights the role of policy in steering innovation toward lower-emission outcomes. - **[Jacobsen, Sallee, Shapiro & van Benthem (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/3/1907/7080183)** Develops a **quantitative fleet model** of the U.S. vehicle market to evaluate emission standards, age-based fees, and scrappage incentives. Finds that **older vehicles dominate residual pollution** and that **age- or emissions-based fees and targeted retirements** produce **larger welfare and environmental benefits** than further tightening new-car standards. - **Relevance:** These studies demonstrate how technology and regulation interact in shaping fleet emissions. For Norway, where new-vehicle emissions are already low due to EV adoption, the primary challenge is **accelerating the retirement of older internal-combustion vehicles**. Evidence supports using **age- or emissions-linked fees** over additional new-car incentives to achieve deeper, faster decarbonization of the vehicle stock. --- ## Modeling Frameworks, Methods & Foundations | Framework | Core Applications | Foundational References | |------------|------------------|--------------------------| | **Structural discrete-choice demand** | [Adda & Cooper (2000)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v108y2000i4p778-806.html); [Knittel (2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Automobiles+on+Steroids%3A+Product+Attribute+Trade-Offs+and++Technological+Progress+in+the+Automobile+Sector&btnG=) | [McFadden (1974)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0191260794900035); [Berry, Levinsohn & Pakes (1995)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/stock/files/berry_levinsohn_pakes_1995.pdf) | | **Dynamic replacement modelling** | [Adda & Cooper (2000)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v108y2000i4p778-806.html); [Busse, Knittel & Zettelmeyer (2013)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23594339) | [Rust (1987)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911259); [Hotz & Miller (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2298122) | | **Reduced-form causal econometrics** | [Jacobsen & van Benthem (2015)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130935); [Mian & Sufi (2012)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23252002) | [Angrist & Krueger (1999)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2648808); [Wooldridge (2002)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2502360196534246213) | | **Fleet equilibrium & simulation models** | [Knittel (2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Automobiles+on+Steroids%3A+Product+Attribute+Trade-Offs+and++Technological+Progress+in+the+Automobile+Sector&btnG=); [Jacobsen, Sallee, Shapiro & van Benthem (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/3/1907/7080183) | [Small & van Dender (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069607000241) | --- ## Schematic Timeline of Key Policy Episodes | Period | Policy Episode | Key Study(s) | |---------|----------------|--------------| | **1994–96** | France: *Balladurette* & *Juppette* scrappage programmes | [Adda & Cooper (2000)](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v108y2000i4p778-806.html) | | **2009** | U.S. *Cash for Clunkers* stimulus | [Mian & Sufi (2012)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23252002); [Li, Linn & Spiller (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069612000678); [Hoekstra, Puller & West (2017)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/691545) | | **2010s–2020s** | Fuel-economy standards, CO₂ taxation, and EV incentives | [Jacobsen & van Benthem (2015)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130935); [Knittel (2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Automobiles+on+Steroids%3A+Product+Attribute+Trade-Offs+and++Technological+Progress+in+the+Automobile+Sector&btnG=); [Jacobsen, Sallee, Shapiro & van Benthem (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/3/1907/7080183) | --- ## Implications for Norway - Norway’s high fuel and CO₂ taxes create strong incentives for efficient vehicle purchases—a context where **consumer behaviour aligns with economic rationality**, as [Busse et al. (2013)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23594339) suggest. - However, **raising new-car costs** (via standards or taxes) without addressing the **used-car market** risks delaying scrappage of old vehicles—the *Gruenspecht effect* demonstrated by [Jacobsen & van Benthem (2015)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130935). - One-off scrappage programmes risk only **pulling forward demand** rather than creating lasting turnover ([Adda & Cooper 2000](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/v108y2000i4p778-806.html); [Mian & Sufi 2012](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23252002)). - Given Norway’s mature EV market, the relevant frontier is **legacy ICE fleet turnover**. **Age- or emissions-based fees** or targeted scrappage could yield higher welfare and environmental gains, as shown in [Jacobsen et al. (2023)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/138/3/1907/7080183). - Empirical methods from this literature—fuel-price instruments, eligibility cutoffs, and structural modeling—can be adapted to Norwegian data to estimate key parameters (e.g., scrap elasticity) and guide fleet-policy design. --- *End of summary.*
