# Phases
Vehicle Scrapping and Environmental Policy
This repository hosts the Phases deliverables for the project. 

## Phase 1
The goal of Phase 1 is to assess data completeness, linkage, and scrappage behavior in Norway’s vehicle registry.

### Contents

Phase1_Data_Inventory_Memo.md — A data inventory memo summarizing key findings, data coverage, and policy context.

Plots/ — Folder containing all figures (34 items) for Phase 1 referenced in the memo (scrapping trends, lifetimes, emission completeness, and policy visuals).

### How to Use

Open Phase1_Data_Inventory_Memo.md to view the analysis and interpretations.

Each figure (e.g., Fig. 1–28) corresponds to files inside the Plots/ folder.

## Phase 2 — Emission Composition and Reconstruction

Method note describing how missing CO₂ and NOₓ values are reconstructed for vehicles in the NPRA registry.
Outlines matching with OFV and VCA reference data, cluster-based estimation, and validation logic linking emissions to odometer readings.


## literature_summary.md 
A structured review of key academic studies on vehicle scrappage, fleet turnover, and related policy design.
Summarizes modeling frameworks, identification strategies, and findings relevant to Norway’s EV transition and emission-reduction policies.
